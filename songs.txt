I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe I'm just happy
My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up
I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb



Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands
He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say he's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say yeah
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

Bell on door clangs, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down, chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face
Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips
I sense others in the room
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered in Aunt Bee's muff

Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass, and the drippings from my ceiling
It's OK to eat fish because they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, hmm-mmm
Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak

She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of Your Highness, I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday, for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found God
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay
My will is good
I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday, for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found God

What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua sea foam shame
Sunburn freezer burn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All in all is all we are

She should've stayed away from friends
She should've had more time to spend
She should've died when she was born
She should've worn the crown of thorns
She should've stood out in a crowd
She should've made her mother proud
She should've fallen on her stance
She should've had another chance
She should've stayed away from friends
She should've had more time to spend
She should've died when she was born
She should've worn the crown of thorns


Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self-assured
Oh, no, I know a dirty word
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido, yeah
Hey
Yeah
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group it's always been
And always will until the end
And I forget, just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind


Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed
Said "Please, don't go!"
Grandma take me home
Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good
Said "Why don't you stop your crying?"
"Go outside and ride your bike"
That's what I did
I killed my toe
After dinner I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms
